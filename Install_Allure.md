#Allure Test Report
Represents a concise test reporting framework
> https://docs.qameta.io/allure/

The following guide helps to enable and include Allure within a Travis pipeline context. 

The extension is developed in the following way:
> - Wait for tests to be executed
> - Collect the tests artifacts on a specific S3 bucket

On the report generation side, a new Travis stage is added "Generate tests report" and is developed in the following way:
> - Download all the tests artifacts from the specified S3 bucket
> - Run the Allure command to generate an aggregated report for all the previous tests executed
> - Upload the generated report inside an S3 bucket

##Allure installation:
1. Set travis aws environment variables or override the existing ones inside your `travis.yaml` file in order to point to the desired bucket:
   
        ARTIFACTS_BUCKET = <aws bucket name>
        ARTIFACTS_KEY = <aws key ID>
        ARTIFACTS_SECRET = <aws key SECRET>
        ARTIFACTS_REGION = <aws region>

2. Open travis.yml file and add below commands line in your `before_install` instructions:
   
        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:qameta/allure -y
        sudo apt-get updated
        sudo apt-get install allure
   
3. On your test stage activate the addon from Travis in order to upload test artifacts in your bucket:
   
        addons:
           artifacts:
               paths:
                   - {PROJECT-LOCATION}/target/surefire-reports
                   - {PROJECT-LOCATION}/target/reports
               target_paths: $TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER/content-filters-tests

4. Add the script `upload_test_artifacts.sh` in your scripts folder:

        # uploads all the artifacts generated by maven surefire to amazon s3 storage based on travis build number
        aws s3 sync s3://test-report-allure/$TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER reports/$TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER
        
        # change directory and list all artifacts in reports folder
        cd reports/$TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER
        export ARTIFACTS_LIST=$(ls)
        
        # print out list of artifacts
        echo $ARTIFACTS_LIST
        
        # allure generates report after clear list of artifacts and set output directory in S3 based on travis build number
        allure generate -c $ARTIFACTS_LIST -o allure/$TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER
        
        # upload and aggregate one single allure report to amazon s3 storage, in the final-report folder,
        # which will contain all test suites results
        aws s3 sync  allure/$TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER s3://test-report-allure/final-report/$TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER


5. Add a new build stage called report:
   
        name: "Generate tests report"    
        stage: report    
        install: skip     
        script:         
            - bash _ci/upload_test_artifacts.sh

##Allure report visualization:
1. Navigate to https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/
2. Login with your aws credentials account
3. Search your bucket where tests artifacts are stored
4. Open folder with aggregated test report, e.g. `final-report`
> - Make sure that above folder is public in order to be able to view the report
5. Open folder which corresponding to travis build number
6. Access `index.html` url
